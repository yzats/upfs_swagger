The response may also include\n  a refresh token which can be used to obtain a new access token without user involvement, but\n  the client must not assume the a refresh token will be returned.\n- With a 2FA challenge (status 412). The response will include a challenge token representing a challenge, and\n  the client must respond with a valid TOTP 2FA code supplied by the user. Depending on the user's 2FA\n  settings, the user obtains the code from their TOTP authenticator app, an SMS sent to them, or\n  an email sent to them.\n- With a parley token (status 200 and token type = \"parley\"). This will only occur when the token type field in the request\n  is set to \"parley\". A parley token can be given to another device, which can then exchange the parley token for its own\n  refresh token.

If too many requests with invalid passwords are made, the account will be temporarily locked and no password-based login requests will be accepted until the lock expires.

It follows the standard jwks format. A good example can be found here https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/reference/jwt/jwks-properties and here https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs.\nClients can use this endpoint to get the public keys then use this public key to verify the signature of the JWTs client receives. One example of using this key is when client receives an access token in JWT format and decode the claims from JWT, but isn't sure that there is no middle man modifying the claim. Then to assure this, client can use the keys returned by this endpoint, to verify the signature from JWTs.\n",
